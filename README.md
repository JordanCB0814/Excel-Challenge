# Excel-Challenge
This is data analysis of a large data set on Excel
Given the data provided, there are 3 takeaways from the Crowdfunding Campaigns

•	Play & Theater was the most successful category of campaigns, suggesting that they have higher interest than the other categories.
•	Success rates peaked in July, dropping during August. Suggesting that perhaps mid-summer is an ideal time for Crowdfunding campaigns to occur.
•	Play & Theater also had the most failure out of all the categories, suggesting perhaps the results come from many campaigns being in those categories.

Some limitations for this data set could be not long enough a duration for our sample. We only have data spanning a yearlong, with no information on what can happen within 2 years or more. Along with no information on how these campaigns were ran, there could be variability in how these campaigns were conducted, resulting in different outcomes. We could also create a chart or graph seeing if there are any takeaways based on country, perhaps some countries are more likely to have less successful campaigns than others.
